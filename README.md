# Is there evidence of climate change in the US tornado statistics?

In [a National Geographic's online educational article](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/tornadoes-and-climate-change), they say that, "when you remove small tornadoes from the record, the data does not suggest any long-term increase in tornado frequency." So, I downloaded data from [Storm Events Database (by the National Centers of Environmental Information)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/) to confirm this:

* [Data collection](data_collection.ipynb)
* [Data cleaning](data_cleaning.ipynb) (including the handling of missing tornado strength information)
* Analysis
